These are my boring neovim dotfiles, closely based on my current vimrc config.

Plugins are instaled as regular packs and tracked by Git submodules.

The provided GNUmakefile is used to fetch and update the packs.

The online backup is hosted at https://git.danirod.es/dotfiles/nvim. There is a
GitHub mirror, but it is read only. Please, do not send GitHub pull requests.
They cannot be accepted due to a GDPR policy and they will be closed
